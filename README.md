# IBM-ML-PROJECT
The machine learning-based fault detection system ingests real-time voltage and current phasor data, preprocesses and extracts key features, and uses an AutoAI-trained machine learning model in IBM watsonx.ai to classify operating conditions. The deployed model outputs fault type predictions instantly, triggering alerts for rapid response and grid protection.
